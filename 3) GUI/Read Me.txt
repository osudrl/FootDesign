GUI (GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Download all files, but the file titled "change_k_app_2" is the only one you need to open and run. This
file calls all of the other functions you downloaded.

This file opens a GUI that can be used to demonstrate the perfect rest concept. The top left shows the
system model being used. The bottom left allows the user to select a desired K_foot value. When changing
the K_foot value, its effect on the foot's oscillatory response can be seen on the right.

The right shows the foot response. The top graph is the foots position (aka: height) while the bottom
graph shows the velocity. The user can adjust the K_foot to attain perfect rest, and see how it
creates a plateau in the foot's height graph ideal for reaching maximum compression (X_stop).

The GUI also has two switches that change the system model:

1) FOOT HARD STOP
Put this in the on position and the system will have a max compression point (X_stop). If the foot is
at the K_foot for perfect rest, the user can see how it allows a smooth transition into the max
compression point. If the K_foot does not allow for perfect rest, the user can see the resulting
discontinuity (aka: a rigid body collision) in both graphs.

2) FOOT DAMPING
Put this to the on position and the foot will become damped. This shows that even if the system has
incorporates damping, as long as there is a velocity peak, the system can still attain perfect
rest.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
There is a bug in the code causing it to crash if both switches are in the "On" position and the
"Foot Damping" switch is moved to "Off." I didn't fix this because the GUI was able to show all
the concepts I needed to convey.  Feel free to open the code and fix if you want. In the Matlab
window, under the "Current Folder" column on the left, right click on "change_k_app_2" and select
"open." This opens the App Designer which allows for editing.
