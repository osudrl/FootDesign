BASIC FOOT SIMULATOR
---------------------------------

Download all files, but the file titled "main" is the only one you need to open and run. This
file is where you input the system parameters, call all of the other functions, and plot the data.

This program allows you to input the system parameters (V, K_leg, M_leg, C_leg, M_foot, C_foot)
and uses an fmincon search function to find the K_foot that creates perfect rest. It then uses
this K_foot value to plot the foot's oscillatory response. It will graph the foot's:

1) POSITION (Top Graph)
Note that at time zero (instant the foot spring contacts the ground), the foot spring has zero
compression (dashed horizontal line in the graph). Thus, the position of the foot is equal
to the foot spring's compression. Also, the horizontal green dashed line shows the desired
X_stop point for this system.

2) VELOCITY (Middle Graph)
Note that the velocity's peak (aka: zero acceleration point) makes contact with the zero
velocity line (dashed horizontal line). This creates the perfect rest point.

3) ACCELERATION (Bottom Graph)



IMPORTANT NOTE
This foot does not reach a max compression point (X_stop). This simulator is meant to tell you
want X_stop and K_foot you would want by displaying the perfect rest point. This simulator
shows continued foot compression after reaching the perfect rest point.
