VISUAL FOOT SIMULATOR
-------------------------------------------------

Download all files, but the file titled "main" is the only one you need to open and run. This
file is where you input the system parameters, call all of the other functions, and plot the data.

This simulator shows a visual representation of the system as it impacts the ground. First, input
the system parameters for your legged system. If you wish to not show the visualization, comment
out the "Animate Hopper" section. If you wish to show the data as separate plots, outside of the
visualization, uncomment the "Show Impact Data" section.

When you run the visualization, it shows the M_leg (aka: M_robot) in red and the M_foot in blue. The top
plot shows the position of both masses. The middle plot shows the foot's velocity, allowing you to
check for perfect rest. The bottom plot shows the Ground Reaction Force (aka: force in the foot spring)
during the impact. The visualization is saved as an AVI video file titled "newfile"

Note that this simulator does not solve for the K_foot value that provides perfect rest. For that,
run the "Basic Foot Simulator" code to get your system's ideal K_foot value. Also note that this
foot does not reach a maximum compression point (X_stop). It shows the oscillations as the
foot continues to move during the impact.
